     Big picture: I want to write a program that helps spaceships calculate the different distance its has to different planets. and also, after the spaceship reaches a planet, the program also has option to continue calculating the distance to another planet if it’s not at its destination yet, in the future, I want to furthermore develop on this program by adding function that could help the spaceship find a route that’s safest and fastest at the same time. 

     1st steps: the calculation of distance has become a reality in my code. I mostly use If and Elif arguments as well as multiple functions to build up this program. it contains knowledge that we haven’t learned yet such as input and calling of 3-D coordinates. Luckily, with help of teacher, this project is completely doable.
      

  
  Application C:
       In the universe, there are all kinds of events which could get in the way of the spaceship’s route, such as star explosion, space trash, invasion of alien ships etc. With this program, just by inputting the possibilities of different events, and run it, you could get the safest route based on the calculations.

      For example, if you want to travel in the solar system, this program needs first based on the map of the solar system and all the risks that are already known. And also other things what are  important are your current location, time, and where is your final destination. There are infinite amounts of possibilities of routes first. By running this program, based on the information that’s already known, the program also eliminates infinite of route until it finally finds out the optimal route.
  Information about unexpected events, needs to include things like the 3D - coordinates, lasting time, and possibility of occurrence etc.



Test:
1. example if the distance calculated is correct by calculating the distance using pythagorean theorem first.
2. run the program.
3. examine if the result comes out is correct.
3. if there is error, start dubugging.

Revisions to plan:
because of only limited options of destinations are provided, user might input some locations that are not included in the codes, so, I use elif argument let the program to re-ask for location when use input somewhere that’s not included.
In addition to that, I also provide multiple choices for the journey plan, for example, you can go to planet Mars first, then go another planet that you want to, and then, the program will help you calculate the lengths of both routes.

Next Step: 
have more stations, and might be able to combine pygame with my project. (Only after playing the game, you are able to move on to the next station).
