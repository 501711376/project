# project
#  I want to write a program that mainly calculate the possibility of certain event and display all the possibility, and at the meantime, it allows user to choose which event shouldn’t be grouped together.

# Application C:
       In the universe, there are all kinds of events which could get in the way of the spaceship’s route, such as star explosion, space trash, invasion of alien ships etc. With this program, just by inputting the possibilities of different events, and run it, you could get the safest route based on the calculations.

      For example, if you want to travel in the solar system, this program needs first based on the map of the solar system and all the risks that are already known. And also other things what are  important are your current location, time, and where is your final destination. There are infinite amounts of possibilities of routes first. By running this program, based on the information that’s already known, the program also eliminates infinite of route until it finally finds out the optimal route.
  Information about unexpected events, needs to include things like the 3D - coordinates, lasting time, and possibility of occurrence etc.

Test:
1.Questions: Is there alien invasion?/ Is there excess amount of small-frequency EM waves such as gamma rays that would deal damage to the ship.
2. What’s the coordinates/ Time/ possibility etc.
3. Input your current informations
3. Calculate.
